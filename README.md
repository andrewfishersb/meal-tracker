As a user…

I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.

I want to view a list of foods I have logged. √

I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).

I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365). √




Further Exploration
If you have completed all objectives, consider additional features such as:

Custom SASS styling with corresponding Gulp tasks to compile.
Display of the total number of calories consumed in a day, and/or the average number of calories consumed in a day.
Add a property that records when each food was eaten. The user could enter a date and time, or the app can generate a timestamp.
Expand the application to display multiple days of food logs. Group the food entries by day. Then include a component to display the total calories for whichever day the user selects.
Add a new master component to average the total calories consumed per day so that the user can figure out how much exercise they should be getting on a regular basis.
